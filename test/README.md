# Xfce Screenshooter Test Suite

This is a poor man's test suite, there are many test scenarios left to be written, but it's a start in the right direction and is infinitely better than relying on manual regression tests.

At the moment no test framework or xfce-test is used to keep things simple, this may be reevaluated at some point. Once things are reliable we should probably add tests to CI.

### How to use

```
cd test
./test.sh
```
